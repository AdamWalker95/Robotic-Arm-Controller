# Robotic-Arm-Controller
This is a project that makes use of a PS3 controller to operate a "robotic arm". The project is written to be intended for use with the 
Arduino microcontroller (in the prototype: the Arduino Uno microcontroller). The project has been written primarily in C++ and makes use of
the USB Host Shield 2.0 library (which will be required for operation of the project). Aside from that, a USB shield, six servos, and a 
frame are required for the build.


27/11/2018 Update: Project prototype has been coded but is currently untested, an external power source will be required to operate the 
system but as of this date a viable power source has been yet purchased.
